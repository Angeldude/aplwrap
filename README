aplwrap is a GTK+-based wrapper for GNU APL.

Usage:
  aplwrap [OPTION...]

Help Options:
  --help               Show help options
  --help-all               Show all help options
  --help-gtk               Show GTK+ Options

Application Options:
  -s, --ftsize             Font size in points (integer).
  -w, --width              Width in pixels (integer).
  -h, --height             Height in pixels (integer).
  -v, --vwidth             Use variable width font.
  -n, --nocolour           Turn off coloured error text. (boolean switch).
  -x, --xeq                Set an absolute or on-path executable APL 
				other than the default, "apl".  (This
				is primarily intended to allow the use
				of uninstalled copies of APL --
					aplwrap -x ./apl
				-- for development purposes.  It's 
				unlikely to work with anything other
				than GNU APL.)
  --LX                     Invoke APL ?LX on startup. (string: APL command or
  			   	expression)
  --display=DISPLAY        X display to use


In use, aplwrap simply provides a textual interface to GNU APL.  The
only things that aren't obvious are:

  1. Pressing "Enter" on any non-empty line sends the contents of that
     line to apl--you don't have to copy-n-paste to re-execute a line.

  2. Under the "Help" button is another button that brings up a keymap image.

  3. Since ctrl-c is bound to the GTK+ copy operation, APL can be interrupted
     by pressing ctrl-break.
