To install aplwrap, it's necessary to have a copy of the GNU APL source code 
installed at least for the duration of the installation of aplwrap. (In order 
to ensure that aplwrap and GNU APL agree on the Unicode-Quad-AV mapping, aplwrap
references appropriate file from GNU APL.)  The GNU APL source can be discarded
after aplwrap is installed.  The configure step below must be specified with 
something like:

./configure --with-apl-source-dir=/mnt/disk5/home/moller/tinkering/aplplot/apl-1.3

aplwrap requires GTK+ version 3.0.12 or newer, including the development
package (like gtk3-devel) if your distribution separates that from the GTK+
library package.

Once the above is in place:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Optionally, if you like, you can alias "aplwrap" to something shorter--
I alias it to "aw."
