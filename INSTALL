To install aplwrap, it's necessary to have a copy of the GNU APL source code 
installed at least for the duration of the installation of aplwrap. (In order 
to ensure that aplwrap and GNU APL agree on the Unicode-Quad-AV mapping, aplwrap
references appropriate file from GNU APL.)  The GNU APL source can be discarded
after aplwrap is installed.  The configure.ac file in the aplwrap sources must 
be edited to point to the top of the GNU APL sources.  The default is:

	APL_SOURCES=-I/mnt/disk5/home/moller/tinkering/aplplot/apl-1.3

which is unlikely to do anyone any good.


aplwrap requires GTK+ version 3.0.12 or newer, including the development
package (like gtk3-devel) if your distribution separates that from the GTK+
library package.

Once the above is in place:

	./autogen.sh
	make
	sudo make install

Optionally, if you like, you can alias "aplwrap" to something shorter--
I alias it to "aw."
